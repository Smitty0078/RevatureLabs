This is the algorithm used to implement the UnitConverter project:

Main Method:
Initialize Variables
While boolean variable remains true
	Prompt user for input to select which converter to run
	Use input given to direct to correct converter
		If volume converter selected
			Invoke volume converter method
		If distance converter selected
			Invoke distance converter method
		If quit app selected
			Set loop control variable to false
		Default
			Handles incorrect input
close input

Quantity Collection Method:
initialize variables
Prompt user to enter number of "units" they selected
return the quantity

Volume Converter Method:
Initialize variables
While boolean variable remains true
	Prompt user for input to select which specific units to convert
		If cups to teaspoons selected
			Invoke quantity collection method
			Invoke cups to teaspoons method
		If teaspoons to tablespoons selected
			Invoke quantity collection method
			Invoke teaspoons to tablespoons method
		If gallons to imperial gallons selected
			Invoke quantity collection method
			Invoke gallons to imperial gallons method
		If quit volume converter is selected
			Set loop control variable to false
		Default
			Handles incorrect input

Distance Converter Method:
initialize variables
Prompt user to enter number of "units" they selected
return the quantity

Volume Converter Method:
Initialize variables
While boolean variable remains true
	Prompt user for input to select which specific units to convert
		If feet to meters selected
			Invoke quantity collection method
			Invoke feet to meters method
		If miles to kilometers selected
			Invoke quantity collection method
			Invoke miles to kilometers method
		If quit distance converter is selected
			Set loop control variable to false
		Default
			Handles incorrect input

Teaspoons to Tablespoons Method:
Assign converted num variable to the product of the quantity of units and the conversion ratio, in this case, 0.333333
Output the conversion to the screen

Cups to Teaspoons Method:
Assign converted num variable to the product of the quantity of units and the conversion ratio, in this case, 48.0
Output the conversion to the screen

Gallons to Imperial Gallons Method:
Assign converted num variable to the product of the quantity of units and the conversion ratio, in this case, 0.832674
Output the conversion to the screen

Miles to Kilometers Method:
Assign converted num variable to the product of the quantity of units and the conversion ratio, in this case, 1.60934
Output the conversion to the screen

Feet to Meters Method:
Assign converted num variable to the product of the quantity of units and the conversion ratio, in this case, 0.3048
Output the conversion to the screen
